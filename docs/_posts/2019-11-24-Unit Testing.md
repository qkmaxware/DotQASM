title: Unit Testing
---
Given the large volume of code that I have been producing for this project, it has become necessary to write unit tests which can help me verify that things are working as expected. Mainly my unit tests focus on the quantum simulator and the matrices for the well defined quantum gates as the parser was tested by my earlier command line utility.
